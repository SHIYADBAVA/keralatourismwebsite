        <!-- Description about District -->
        <p class="para pt-4">The quaint town of Palakkad in central Kerala boasts of picturesque landscape, tranquil scenery and clear backwaters. Also known as Palghat, Pallakad is located near a wide low pass in the Western Ghats mountain ranges. Palakkad is the land of Palmyras and Paddy Fields and is famous as the chief granary of Kerala.

          Palakkad gets its name from pala trees which once dominated the area. This is the area which links Kerala to Tamil Nadu and perhaps does so in a cultural sense too, since the language spoken in the villages here is Tamil, unlike the rest of the state where Malayalam is prevalent. 
          
          Palakkad is known for the ruins of Tipu Sulthan's Fort, four dams and one of the first amusement parks of Kerala - Fantasy Park. Some other locations that can be visited in the area include the Palakkad Fort, Silent Valley National Park, Pothundy Dam, Jain Temple, Dhoni waterfalls, Walayar Dam etc.

                  <p class="card-text text-left">The Palakkad Fort in Kerala is a beautiful historical monument that has gently integrated its high walls with its surrounding green gardens. One of the most well-preserved forts in the state of Kerala, the Palakkad fort was built in the 1766 AD by Hyder Ali and is now a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India. This picturesque fort is located in the heart of Palakkad town at the foothills of the Sahyadris range in a labyrinth of dense forests and crisscrossing cascading rivers. The mighty fort is spread over an area of 60,702 square meters and is immensely famous for its architecture, which displays the efficiency of the French craftsman. The magnificent fortress of Pallakad is an essential part of history, and its construction is majestic as well

                    The fort is in the shape of a square and is supported by walls and bastions which are square shaped as well. Earlier, the entrance to the fort was via a drawbridge, which has now been replaced by a permanent one in its place.</p>

                  <p class="card-text text-left">One of the largest reservoirs of Kerala, Malampuzha Dam is located near Palakkad in South India. It is surrounded by the Western Ghats on all side. Malampuzha Dam is a combination of a masonry dam with a length of 1,849 meters and an earthen dam with a height of 220 meters. The dam is 355 feet high and crosses the Malampuzha River, which is a tributary of Bharathappuzha, which is Kerala's second largest river. The dam has many attractions nearby like the rock garden, ropeway, amusement park and visitors often enjoy boating here as well. 

                    It is the largest reservoir in Kerala and is served by a network of two canal systems. Its construction was initiated in 1949, and it took about six years to finish the project. The foundation stone of the project was laid on 27 March 1949 by the then Public Works Minister, Sri. M. Bhaktavatsalam. During the time of its initiation, Palakkad was a part of Madras presidency. The dam was inaugurated on 9 October 1955 by the then Chief Minister of Madras, Sri. K. Kamaraj.</p>
