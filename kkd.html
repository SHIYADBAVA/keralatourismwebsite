        <h2 id="welcome" class="text-center pt-2">"A colonial city of trade and tourism"</h2>
        <p class="para pt-2">Formerly known as Calicut, Kozhikode is located in Kerala. It was the Capital of Malabar during the Zamorin rule 500 years ago and is famous for its centuries-old trade in cotton and spices with Jews, Arabs, Phoenicians and Chinese. Basking in the idyllic setting of the serene Arabian Sea on the west and the proud peaks of the Wayanad hills on the east, this district with the serene beaches, lush green countryside, historic sites, all combine to make Kozhikode a popular tourist destination.

          Vasco da Gama had set his foot on the remote beach of Kappad in Kozhikode in 1498 and 'Discovered India' and established spice trade routes with the west. Kozhikode city is the marketing centre for commodities like pepper coconut, coffee, rubber, lemongrass oil etc., produced in Kozhikode and the neighbouring districts of Wayanad, Malappuram and Kannur.  Being the major trade centre in Malabar and major exporter to foreign countries, the international travellers christened this district as ‘the noble emporium of India’. </p>

                  <p class="card-text text-left">Pondicherry is not the only seashore with European history, the Kappad Beach in Kerala is infamous for being the destination of Vasco Da Gama, the famous Portuguese explorer. It is the shore that made the explorer the first to reach India by sea. Today, Kappad is one of the most scenic beaches India has to offer. It is lined with palm trees and sedimentary rocks that decorate the shore and give any visitor a serene feeling. The idyllic beach is apt for rejuvenation of body and soul. 

                    Since 1498, Kappad became a very important port with regard to trade between Europe and Asia. It was this voyage of Vasco Da Gama that led to the establishment of a permanent route for the Europeans to reach India. This beach was the reason for the Spice route to exist. Kappad beach is presently in the district of Kozhikode and is also known as Kappakkadavu. The beach is perfect for swimming, boating, beach games and activities with your loved ones. The beach also provides activities like Paragliding, Snorkelling and Surfing for adventure seekers or just anyone who wants to try something new.</p>

                  <p class="card-text text-left">Beypore is a cosy coastal town tucked away in the small but striking Kozhikode District. Located at the mouth of the energetic Chaliyar River, this town is covered in vibrant shades of green and surrounded by mystic shades of blue. When under the reign of Tipu Sultan, who was the ruler of Mysore, this town was named Sultan Pattanam.

                    In spite of being a small town, it is very famous for ship-building. The shipbuilding yard here is renowned for the construction of Urus and Dhows, the traditional Arabian trading vessel. This craft is over 1500 years old now and is carried out carefully by the expert craftsmen who possess extraordinary skills.In fact, the flagship of the British admiral, Lord Horatio Nelson who defeated Napoleon Bonaparte in the Battle of Trafalgar in the year 1805 was made in Beypore along with numerous other vessels of his celebrated fleet. Also, the sturdy wooden barges sailed across the Suez Canal during the reign of Cleopatra are also said to have been made at Beypore. What is mind-boggling is that no matter how big or complicated the ship to be built is, no formal plan or design or sketches is ever made All these computations are always in mind and at the fingertips of the foreman.</p>

                    <p class="card-text text-left">Located on the northern side of the scenic state of Kerala, Kozhikode has always been a popular destination for its backwaters. These backwaters are a distinctive feature of this area and have been generously blessed with abundant natural beauty, dense greenery and exotic flora and fauna. The palm-fringed rivulets, lakes and canals of Kozhikode are decked with engaging beauty. The calm of these undisturbed waters is contagious and instils within you a feeling of tranquil peace and serenity. Unlike most rivers that flow towards the direction of the seas and oceans, backwaters are a part of the river that has little or no current. So, boating in the backwaters allows you to move against the natural current! Here at Kozhikode, Canoli River and Kallai River are blessed with these wondrous backwater streams.
