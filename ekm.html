        <h2 id="welcome" class="text-center pt-2">"Heart of Kerala"</h2>
        <p class="para pt-2">Ernakulam is a portion of the city of Kochi in central Kerala, India and has lent its name to the Ernakulam district. The Kerala High Court, the office of the Kochi Municipal Corporation and the Cochin Stock Exchange are situated here in Ernakulam. The Ernakulam Junction is a major railway station of the Indian Railways. Initially, Ernakulam was the headquarters of the Ernakulam District but was later shifted to Kakkanad. Ernakulam was once the capital of the Kingdom of Cochin. It is located 220 kilometres (137 mi) north-west of the state capital Thiruvananthapuram. The city has served as an incubator for many Malayali entrepreneurs and is a major financial and commercial hub of Kerala.

          The state government and the GCDA have plans to include Angamaly, Perumbavoor, Piravom and Kolenchery in the Ernakulam district; Mala and Kodungallur in the Thrissur district; Thalayolaparambu and Vaikom in Kottayam; and Cherthala in the Alappuzha district within the Kochi metropolitan limits. The newly formed metropolis would be put under the charge of a new authority called Kochi Metropolitan Regional Development Authority.</p>

                  <p class="card-text text-left">Fort Kochi is a seaside town in the south-western part of Main Kochi which is known for its old-world colonial charm. The place still holds on to every single cultural change it has gone through over the centuries. We can see remnants of British rule all over the country. But tourists flock hear all around the year to have a glimpse of how Portuguese or Dutch colonialism affected parts of our country. The quaint city is dotted with similar structures and has an overall ambience that keeps reminding you of the colonial powers that once ruled over the place.

                    The fort region of Kochi has seen the rise and fall of some European powers, mainly the Portuguese and the Chinese before that and the Dutch after, before it went under the nation-wide British rule in the 18th century. Fort Kochi is dotted with European structures, churches and other architectural buildings which take you right back to a different era back in time.</p>

                    <p class="card-text text-left">Also known as Paradesi Synagogue or Mattancherry Synagogue, Cochin Jewish Synagogue is the oldest active synagogue, not just in Kochi but in the Commonwealth of Nations. Located in the Jew Town area of Kochi, the synagogue was constructed in 1567 and is one of the seven synagogues of the Malabar Yehudan or Yehudan Mappila.

                      The synagogue shares its walls with the Mattancherry Palace and was built by Spanish- speaking Jews; therefore, it is also known as ‘Paradesi’ meaning ‘foreigners’. Boasting of rare antiques including beautiful chandeliers, clock tower, brass railed pulpit, Chinese hand-painted tiles etc. and striking architecture, the synagogue has four buildings of its own. In 1662, the synagogue was ruined by the Portuguese but was later renovated by the Dutch after 2 years.

                    <p class="card-text text-left">Popularly known as Cheenavala, the Chinese Fishing Nets are the most iconic and popular attractions of Kerala peculiar to Kochi located next to Fort Kochi. One of the significant cultural symbols of Kerala, the spot is also one of the most photographed places in all of the town, attracting hordes of tourists and photographers on an everyday basis.

                      The Chinese Fishing Nets are basically vast fishing nets which are fixed on bamboo and teak poles. They are then let down into the sea through unique mechanisms and by weighing them down with large stones tied to ropes. These nets are left in the sea before they are pulled back again by tugging the ropes after collecting a significant amount of catch. Considered to be the ingenious way of fishing, these majestic Chinese fishing nets are operated by four to six fishermen and watching this spectacular process is in itself a spellbinding experience.</p>
